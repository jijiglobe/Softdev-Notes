To include certain functions in your program (similar to importing) use #include <packagename>
   most of your code will begin with
   	#include <stdio>
	#include <stdlib>
   this will include the standard in/out and standard lib in your prgram

You can also write .h files that you can include

PATH is a list of locations where you keep executables
export $PATH displays your PATH list

To run a program that is not included in PATH you can use ./[filename]

keep in mind that you cannot printf( "varname = "+ varname ) because strings are immutable
     instead to do the same thing use printf( "varname = %vartype", bob )
     	     the compiler holds a place n the printf string to be replaced with a [vartype]
	     The formatting characters are as follows
	     	 float: %f
		 double: %lf
		 int: %d
		 long: %ld
		 char: %c
		 char array: %s
		 pointer: %p

	     A pro tip is to use this syntax:
	       	 %0.<x>f; to print x digits of f
